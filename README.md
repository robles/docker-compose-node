# docker-compose-node
- Express api that runs in container
- connects to mongodb in separate container
- tied together by docker-compose
- client app will come when i decide on which library to use. (react, vue, svelte ... though i'm thinking of trying out solidjs)

## Project setup

### Start application
```
docker-compose up
```
